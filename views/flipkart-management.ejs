                    <p>Setting up your Flipkart seller account is the first step towards e-commerce success. When you
                        create your account, you'll need to provide accurate business information, including your
                        business type, GST details, and bank account information.</p>
                    <p>Choose between a Basic and a Premium seller account based on your business needs and preferences.
                        A Premium account comes with added benefits like reduced commissions.</p>
                    <p>Be sure to customize your Flipkart seller profile with a logo, banner, and an informative 'About
                        Us' section. A well-optimized seller account enhances your brand's credibility and builds trust
                        with potential customers.</p>
